# Sounds-of-the-Solar-System

This Outer Wilds-inspired planetary music website employs Astropy's *astroquery* package to query NASA's JPL Horizons for real-time planetary positions relative to the sun. Utilizing the acquired coordinates, each planet (representing a specific note) is categorized into one of nine nonants, representing distinct pitches in the Scientific Pitch Notation.

**File guide**:

+ `scripts/generateDatesData.py` â†’ Using *astroquery*'s "Horizon" to get the relative coordinates of the planets (by date) generate a JSON file with the nonnat derived from those cordinates.
+ `assets/data/` â†’ Generated JSON files with planets' nonant by date (every other file on the assets folder is an image).
+ `scripts/canvas.js` â†’ Drawing background of the canvas.
+ `script/planets_n_sounds.js` â†’ Assigning frequencies to each planet and positioning them in their place according to the data from the corresponding date on the JSON file.
+ `index.html` â†’ Main website file.
